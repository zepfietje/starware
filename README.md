# Starware

Starware is a type of license that helps promising projects grow and glow up.  
This is done by requiring its users to star the project's GitHub repository.

## Usage

1. Add the Starware badge to the top of your project's README file.
   ```markdown
   [![Starware](https://img.shields.io/badge/Starware-%E2%AD%90-black?labelColor=%23f9b00d)](https://github.com/zepfietje/starware)
   ```
2. Add the Starware license section to the bottom of your project's README file.

   ```markdown
   ## Starware

   <!-- TODO: project name --> is Starware.
   This means you're free to use the project, as long as you star its GitHub repository.
   Your appreciation makes us grow and glow up. ‚≠ê
   ```
