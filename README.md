  Starware is a type of license that helps promising projects grow and glow up.<br>
  This is done by requiring its users to star the project's GitHub repository.
</p>

## Usage

1. Add the Starware badge to the top of your project's README file.
   ```markdown
   [![Starware](https://img.shields.io/badge/⭐-Starware-f5a91a?labelColor=black)](https://github.com/zepfietje/starware)
   ```
   [![Starware](https://img.shields.io/badge/⭐-Starware-f5a91a?labelColor=black)](https://github.com/zepfietje/starware)
2. Add the Starware license section to the bottom of your project's README file.

   ```markdown
   ## Starware

   <!-- TODO: project name --> is Starware.  
   This means you're free to use the project, as long as you star its GitHub repository.  
   Your appreciation makes us grow and glow up. ⭐
   ```

## Motivation

Contributing to open source can be daunting at first, let alone creating and maintaining your own open-source projects.
Running your open-source project doesn't always feel rewarding, even though it does cost a lot of time and effort.

That's where Starware comes into play.
By requiring users of your project to actively show appreciation by starring the GitHub repository, you're directly praised for the work you've done.

Additionally, it helps promising projects grow, as GitHub stars are the de facto unit of measurement for trending repositories.

Let's make open source even more accessible and fun! ❤️
